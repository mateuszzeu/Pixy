## 💡 What’s Pixy?

Pixy is a simple, focused experiment built around one concept:  
**Send a Pix – a short, meaningful message that shows up instantly on your partner’s widget.**

Think of it as a stripped-down, private snap – but with pure intent.  
No feed. No history. Just connection.

This is a **work-in-progress**, currently focused on text-based Pix – images coming soon.

## ✨ Core Features

- 🔐 **Local Auth & Storage** – Lightweight account system with Core Data.
- 💬 **Instant Pix Delivery** – Write short messages and push them directly to the recipient's widget.
- 🧼 **Minimal UI** – Nothing extra, just sender, message, and time.
- 🧩 **Widget Integration** – Message appears right on the home screen for maximum impact.
- 🚧 **Future-ready** – Built with image-based Pix in mind – this is just the start.

## 🚀 Vision

Pixy is more than a message.  
It’s a **gesture**. A **nudge**. A digital "thinking of you."  
No clutter, no likes, no read receipts. Just a Pix.
